# Calculator_Assignment
#In this assignment, I had learned about implementing mathematical functions in android studio, as well as practiced more with
#buttons, event listeners, editText, and dimens, allowing me to manipulate information and build a better functioning app. I had
#consulted tutorials when I got stuck, but I was able to create a functional calculator.
